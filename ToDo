Welcome to the ToDo
%This is what has to be done%

1. Index page
  -Big font needs to be changed
  -space out the selection of language (i.e. ASSEMBLY    HASKELL)
  -work on the sizing of different elements
  -fix the links once you click
  -slow down the typing of the larger words
2. Home page
  a. page tittle
    -increase the font size a little bit
    -move it down from the top of the page so its more spaced out
    -add under it a 1 to 2 line description of the page, not that it should
     not be wider then 2 times the width of marianonymous and if it is push
     it to the next line (font sixe should be slightly smaller then title)
    -add if possible a blinking cursor after the title
  b. content
    -work on the divisions of the page (i.e. text on one side and img on the other)
     note that we want everything to look as clean as possible so space is your friend
     DO NOT OVERCROUD
    -if page rescales and becomes to small for this format we should switch it to a
     img and text under so that it never overcrouds
  c. MISC
    -add the logo as a favicon or whatever its called such that it appears in the tab
     selector
    -add a small en/fr button somewhere on the bottom and get it to work
3. Navigator
  -get cursor to blink when it is in small mode
  -either move cursor inline with the last line of printed text (i.e. no line break)
   or remove the space that happens after the line break (i prefer the first option)
  -get mouse over to work nicely and fix the bug that happens if you open and close the
   navigator while it is still printing text (this will take care of the issue that when
   you click on a link it closes the navigator).
