Welcome to the ToDo
%This is what has to be done%

1. Index page
  -Big font needs to be changed
  -space out the selection of language (i.e. ASSEMBLY    HASKELL)
  -work on the sizing of different elements
  -fix the links once you click
  -slow down the typing of the larger words
2. Home page
  work on rescale
  input text 
  fr/en button
3. Navigator
  -get cursor to blink when it is in small mode
  -either move cursor inline with the last line of printed text (i.e. no line break)
   or remove the space that happens after the line break (i prefer the first option)
  -get mouse over to work nicely and fix the bug that happens if you open and close the
   navigator while it is still printing text (this will take care of the issue that when
   you click on a link it closes the navigator).
4. Team page
	space out from sides and input text
5. About us
	-mostly done for us, perhaps a picture slide show of the school and the robotics work rooms
6. gallery
	-just a bunch of pictures in a grid and if you click on one it will go full screen or something
7. robot
	-We have a 3d model of it and we might get it interactively working (user can spin and zoom)
	-short description written for us
8. Video
	-a page with simply the video
9. game
	-A animation was created for us and some text was written
