Welcome to the ToDo
%This is what has to be done%

1. Index page
  -Big font needs to be changed
  -space out the selection of language (i.e. ASSEMBLY    HASKELL)
  -work on the sizing of different elements
  -fix the links once you click
  -slow down the typing of the larger words
2. Home page
  a. page tittle
    -increase the font size a little bit
    -move it down from the top of the page so its more spaced out
    -add under it a 1 to 2 line description of the page, not that it should
     not be wider then 2 times the width of marianonymous and if it is push
     it to the next line (font sixe should be slightly smaller then title)
    -add if possible a blinking cursor after the title
  b. content
    -work on the divisions of the page (i.e. text on one side and img on the other)
     note that we want everything to look as clean as possible so space is your friend
     DO NOT OVERCROUD
    -if page rescales and becomes to small for this format we should switch it to a
     img and text under so that it never overcrouds
  c. MISC
    -add the logo as a favicon or whatever its called such that it appears in the tab
     selector
    -add a small en/fr button somewhere on the bottom and get it to work
3. Navigator
  -get cursor to blink when it is in small mode
  -either move cursor inline with the last line of printed text (i.e. no line break)
   or remove the space that happens after the line break (i prefer the first option)
  -get mouse over to work nicely and fix the bug that happens if you open and close the
   navigator while it is still printing text (this will take care of the issue that when
   you click on a link it closes the navigator).
4. Team page
	-stick to similar format as last year
	-peter and panayota at top
	-everyone else in a slightly offset grid such that we have the picture and username one above the other
	 and the text is on the right for pictures on the left and on the left for pictures on the right
	-once you mouse over, the picture turns into the gif and the username turns into the name
5. About us
	-mostly done for us, perhaps a picture slide show of the school and the robotics work rooms
6. gallery
	-just a bunch of pictures in a grid and if you click on one it will go full screen or something
7. robot
	-We have a 3d model of it and we might get it interactively working (user can spin and zoom)
	-short description written for us
8. Video
	-a page with simply the video
9. game
	-A animation was created for us and some text was written
