        I am a team captain. <br>
        I enjoyed what I have enjoyed about this years team is how cohesively we all work together. We put in tireless amount of hours of hard work to make sure our robot reflects our best capabilities, while finding time to have fun and joke around, which allowed for friendships to be made. while I found what I have found challenging is having to learn to be more organized to be able to balance all the responsibilities of being captain. difficult <br>
        The biggest sacrifice I made is Sleep. The ability to sleep in gets robbed of me every Christmas break - but in the end it’s all worth it. and fun fact about me is I own a pair of of spongebob socks!     </div>

        As far as sacrifices go, the main one has been time from my winter break.
        Fun fact, I run Linux on my computers! </div>		</div>

        I am part of the robot and kiosk team. <br>
        I love the fact that I am able to learn new and interesting ways of solving problems that I have otherwise found impossible to overcome. I truly enjoyed working on the kiosk as well, which was a brand new task that allowed me to broaden my practical and creative skills. However, keeping up with the more adept members of the team has been a challenge because sometimes, I'm simply out of my depth and am not able to contribute as much as I'd like.  <br>
        The biggest sacrifice I made is that my "sleep until 1 pm" schedule has been slightly interrupted by the robotics work flow. Fun fact about me is I can unhinge my jaw like a goddamn snake, I think that's pretty cool ! <br>
