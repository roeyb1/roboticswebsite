      <p>Our aspiring hackers have been working tirelessly for weeks to complete the seemingly difficult task assigned to them by anonymous. Named D.E.N.N.I.S., our hackers designed a robot that can pick up footballs and launch them at various targets.</p>
      <div style="display:inline-block;">
        <img id="whel" src="../media/robot/wheel.png" height="360px" width="360px" style="height:auto; max-width:100%; float:right; padding-left:10px; margin-top:20px">
        <p>The first step consisted of determining the type and size of wheels used for the drive train. The result of these heated deliberations was to use mechanim wheels. Following this decision, our hackers began building the frame of the robot out of aluminum. </p>

      <div style="padding-bottom:15px">
        <p>The next step was to decide the launching mechanism of the game pieces. After a long thought process, our ambitious hackers determined that the most consistent and accurate method would be to use two wheels. Mounted 18 inches above the ground, both wheels spin at a fast speed in order to be able to shoot the game pieces roughly 5 meters in distance. After successfully shooting the football through both wheels, the next task was to determine a method for loading the launcher. By creating a path with multiple small wheels leading to the launcher wheels, our hackers designed a robot that will be able to shoot the footballs regardless of their orientation. </p>

      </div>

      <p>The most difficult task our hackers faced was inventing a method to pick up the game pieces. Ideally, the mechanism would be able to load more than one ball at a time to maximize their scoring potential. Using two buckets fused together, our hackers designed a scooping method attached to a pulley system. Once the game pieces have been obtained by D.E.N.N.I.S., the pickup mechanism is lifted and places the footballs into a sorter for the launcher. </p>
      <p>During this gruelling process, our hackers faced several challenges such as creating a mechanism that will lift the footballs regardless of their orientation on the ground in order to minimize the amount of time required during this process. Moreover, the ramp at the ends of the game board also proved to be difficult for D.E.N.N.I.S., primarily determining the center of mass. Lastly, it was crucial to our hackers that the launching of the footballs be consistent. In order to accomplish this, the shooter had to be stable on the robot.</p>
      <p>Despite these various challenges, our hackers persevered and came up with solutions to accomplish the task set by anonymous. Make big claw (Solution 1). Place counterweights and arm solves all our problems (Solution 2). Lastly, our team built custom mounts in order to stabilize the drills used for the shooting mechanism.</p>
