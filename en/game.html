    <div class="gameDescription" >
      <p>Our task, assigned to us by anonymous, consists of building a robot which can launch modified footballs, also known as game pieces, at various targets. Initially, the robot can have a width and length of three feet with a height of four feet. Once the heat has begun, the robot can expand to four feet in width and length. The game is played in teams of two, who begin on either side of the board, each pre-loaded with 5 footballs. Teams have an additional possible 30 game pieces located on the upper and lower levels of the game board in various dispensers. The objective of each team is to gain as many points as possible in the span of five minutes.</p>
      <p>Teams gain points by throwing game pieces through a V shaped target corresponding to their teams' assigned colors in order to obtain 20 points per ball. These V targets are located at each end of the board on an upper level platform reached by climbing a 30o ramp. In front of each V shaped target is a 3 level multiplier on the upper platform. Once a game piece is placed in this multiplier, no more footballs can be launched into the V shaped target. If no game pieces are placed in the multiplier, then their score is multiplied by zero. If one football is placed in the first level then their score achieved by the V shape is multiplied by one, two footballs in the second level multiplies their score by two and three game piece... you get the idea. Different levels are accessed by opening the latches found on the side of the multipliers. <p>
	    <p>At the center of the field lies the quad-core which contains two compartments for each team. The quad-core is constantly rotating and is used as a multiplier for all points. The multiplied score is calculated based on a ratio of the number of game pieces placed into the quad-core by each team with a maximum of a multiplier of two. </p>
	    <p>Located on the board are two prisms, each assigned a different color. Within each prism is a cylinder corresponding to the other team's color. Each team receives 10 points for placing a football in their team's prism and 30 points for the cylinder. </p>
	    <p>In order to obtain points during a heat, a robot must contribute to their team's score by placing a minimum of one game piece into either the V shaped target or any of the multipliers. If a robot fails to do so, they are deemed as an inactive robot. If a robot is paired with an inactive robot, that team is rewarded a multiplier of 1.5 to compensate for their team's incompetence. </p>
	    <p>The preliminary rounds decide the ranking for playoffs. The lowest two scores from the preliminary rounds are dropped when calculating each team's ranking.</p>
