	<br> "I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, . . . and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room" (Eugenides 3)<br>
	<br>"My birth certificate lists my name as Calliope Helen Stephanides. My most recent driver's license (from the Federal Republic of Germany) records my first name simply as Cal" (3).
	<br>"I've left my body in order to occupy othersâ€”and all this happened before I turned sixteen" (3).<br>	Logical progression and thesis development: [Quotation number from above]<br>Identity is a central idea of the text.  Identity appears in many forms, such as ethnic/national identity and gender identity.  One of the examples of ethnic identity is Milton's relationship with his American present and his Greek roots.  Despite Milton's assertions that he is American, his serving in the American Army [28], and his willingness to turn his back on Greece [6, 45], he is unable to fully separate himself from his Greek identity, as can be seen when he is buying a house [20].  Milton tries very hard to be American, not Greek, but he is unsuccessful.  Despite changing his name [42], he is still viewed as Greek [20].  A similar situation can be observed in the case of Milton's parents, Desdemona and Lefty.  This case, however, does not rely on the concept of ethnic identity.  Instead, the identity that Desdemona and Lefty seek to change is their familial identity.  At the beginning of the text, they are siblings, living in a small Greek village in Turkey [11].  However, as Lefty has difficulty finding a suitable partner, he suggests to his sister that they marry [46].  The basis for the suggestion is that, despite being siblings, the two are also third-cousins.  In the Greek Orthodox tradition, third-cousins can marry.  This decision begins a life-long journey to transform from siblings into husband and wife.  On the boat to America, the siblings try to transform into a couple [35, 39].  Despite all attempts to cover up their past, however, Desdemona and Lefty are unable to completely hide the fact that they are siblings [31; 32].  As Lefty gets older and forgets the present, he gradually returns to thinking of Desdemona as his sister, not as his wife [32].  Even after Lefty passes away, Desdemona is still haunted by the nature of her relationship with her husband.  In fact, the text ends where it began, with a discussion of how Desdemona and Lefty are related. Desdemona finally reveals to Cal, after all these years, that she and Lefty were indeed siblings [31].  Desdemona and Lefty are unable to transition from siblings to wife and husband, despite all their attempts.  They cannot escape the reality of their relationship.  In the area of relationships, Cal also undergoes immense transformation.  However, Cal's changes do not relate to interpersonal interactions, rather to intrapersonal interactions.  Cal grows up as a girl, and then becomes a boy [1].  However, despite the transformation, Callie occasionally returns to remind Cal of his past [33].  Despite the fact that Cal becomes a boy in order to match his chromosomal nature, there are times when he reverts to his female past.  Callie's return can be seen when Cal describes the experience of her climbing into his body [33].  Cal experiences, as well as those of Desdemona and Milton, reveal that identity is not fully determined by nature, nurture, or even choice.  Identity is complicated and shaped by many factors.  Another character whose experiences are directly related to the idea of identity is Jimmy Zizmo. Jimmy Zizmo easily changes identities, casting off one to put on another, transforming from Jimmy to Fard Muhammad.  However, despite his apparent success at transforming, there is a tremendous cost. Jimmy changes identities, but loses his family and property in the process.  For him, this price may not be a sacrifice.  However, in a social world, it is very difficult to start fresh.  Therefore, except for the exceptional case of Jimmy Zizmo, identity is difficult to completely change.
